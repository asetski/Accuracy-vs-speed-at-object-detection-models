# Accuracy-vs-speed-at-object-detection-models
Comparing accuracy and speed trade-offs in  object detection models using Tensor Flow framework

The system uses several existing ready-to-use datasets listed in TensorFlow library. 
The code is written in Python 3.8 using Jupiter Notebook with installed TensorFlow 2.6.0 platform.

The following Python libraries were used: 
  Pandas for data analysis,
  NumPy for operation on array and matrices,
  Matplotlib for graphical visualization,
  Keras for neural network visualization, 
  Timeit for tracking execution time
  
Code implementation is broken into several sections: 
  Data preparation,
  Data splitting,
  Creating model, 
  Compiling model,
  Training model,
  Evaluation.
